** Acronym Tools

*** [[file:ibm_acronym.sh][ibm_acronym.sh]] - IBM/Tech Acronym Decoder & Generator v3.0
*Created:* [2025-10-02 18:55:00]
*Updated:* [2025-10-03 19:30:00]
*Purpose:* Look up real tech acronyms from NIST CSRC glossary, generate funny alternatives, with definitions and source links
*Category:* Utility / Humor Hybrid

*Description:*
A powerful yet humorous tool that decodes 4000+ technology acronyms from the authoritative NIST CSRC (Cybersecurity Resource Center) glossary. Provides full definitions, source publication links (NIST Special Publications), and direct links to NIST glossary pages. Also generates hilarious alternative interpretations and auto-generates plausible technical expansions for unknown acronyms. Features fuzzy search to suggest similar acronyms when you make typos.

*Usage:*
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Look up an acronym (shows definitions, sources, + funny versions)
./ibm_acronym.sh 2FA
./ibm_acronym.sh TPF

# Add a new verified acronym
./ibm_acronym.sh add WATSON "Witty AI Tool" product

# List all acronyms (or filter)
./ibm_acronym.sh list
./ibm_acronym.sh list NIST

# Show database statistics
./ibm_acronym.sh stats

# Fuzzy search suggestions
./ibm_acronym.sh RAD   # Suggests RAID, etc.

# Promote AI-generated to verified
./ibm_acronym.sh promote DEMO "Demonstration Environment" tech
#+END_SRC

*Example Output:*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
=== IBM Acronym Decoder ===
Looking up: 2FA

‚úì Found in database (2 definitions):

üìñ Definition 1: Multifactor Authentication [security]
   Authentication using two or more factors to achieve authentication.
   Factors include: (i) something you know (e.g., password/PIN);
   (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic device, token);
   or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric).

** Satire & Commentary Generators

*** [[file:avi_loeb.sh][avi_loeb.sh]] - Avi Loeb Commentary Generator
*Created:* [2025-10-02 18:45:00]
*Purpose:* Satirical commentary generator in the style of physicist Avi Loeb
*Category:* Satire / Entertainment

*Description:*
Generates over-the-top cosmic commentary on mundane topics in the distinctive style of theoretical physicist Avi Loeb. Takes any topic as input and produces grandiose observations connecting it to extraterrestrial intelligence, interstellar objects, and the Galilean pursuit of truth.

*Usage:*
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Generate commentary on any topic
./avi_loeb.sh "coffee maker"

# Or run interactively
./avi_loeb.sh
#+END_SRC

*Example Output:*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
As I've argued in my latest preprint, the coffee maker exhibits
characteristics inconsistent with natural terrestrial appliances.
Its precise temperature regulation suggests possible technosignatures.
The establishment dismisses this, but as Galileo knew, orthodoxy
often blinds us to extraordinary truths hiding in plain sight...
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Features:*
- Multiple randomized templates
- Authentic Loeb-isms: "As I've argued...", "The establishment...", "Galileo knew..."
- References to Oumuamua, interstellar objects, and technosignatures
- Academic gravitas applied to absurd topics
- Perfect for lightening the mood in research meetings

- No external dependencies unless noted

** Testing
These scripts are provided "as-is" with no warranty. Test before using in any context where accuracy matters (hint: probably shouldn't use satire scripts where accuracy matters).

* Disclaimer

All scripts in this directory are for entertainment and educational purposes only. Any resemblance to actual scientific claims, corporate strategies, or serious research is purely coincidental and probably satirical.

The Avi Loeb commentary generator is a parody and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of the actual Avi Loeb or his scientific work.
