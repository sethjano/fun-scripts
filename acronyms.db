CAPI|Cryptographic Application Programming Interface|An application programming interface included with Microsoft Windows operating systems that provides services to enable developers to secure Windows-based applications using cryptography. While providing a consistent API for applications, API allows for specialized cryptographic modules (cryptographic service providers) to be provided by third parties, such as hardware security module (HSM) manufacturers. This enables applications to leverage the additional security of HSMs while using the same APIs they use to access built-in Windows cryptographic service providers. (Also known variously as CryptoAPI, Microsoft Cryptography API, MS-CAPI or simply CAPI)|security|VERIFIED|NIST|NIST SP 1800-16B|https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-16|https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/capi

EOT|expectation over transformation|A method for strengthening adversarial examples to re­main adversarial under image transformations that occur in the real world, such as angle and viewpoint changes. EOT models these perturbations within the opti­mization procedure. Rather than optimizing the log-likelihood of a single example, EOT uses a chosen distribution of transformation functions that take an input con­trolled by the adversary to the “true” input perceived by the classifier.|technology|VERIFIED|NIST|NIST AI 100-2e2025|https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-2e2025|https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/eot

SoD|Separation of Duty (SOD)|refers to the principle that no user should be given enough privileges to misuse the system on their own. For example, the person authorizing a paycheck should not also be the one who can prepare them. Separation of duties can be enforced either statically (by defining conflicting roles, i.e., roles which cannot be executed by the same user) or dynamically (by enforcing the control at access time). An example of dynamic separation of duty is the two-person rule. The first user to execute a two-person operation can be any authorized user, whereas the second user can be any authorized user different from the first [R.S. Sandhu., and P Samarati, “Access Control: Principles and Practice,” IEEE Communications Magazine 32(9), September 1994, pp. 40-48.]. There are various types of SOD, an important one is history-based SOD that regulate for example, the same subject (role) cannot access the same object for variable number of times.|technology|VERIFIED|NIST|NIST SP 800-192|https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-192|https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/sod

WGS 84|World Geodetic System – 1984|An Earth-centered, Earth-fixed terrestrial reference system and geodetic datum. WGS 84 is based on a consistent set of constants and model parameters that describe the Earth’s size, shape, gravity, and geomagnetic fields. WGS 84 is the standard U.S. Department of Defense definition of a global reference system for geospatial information and is the reference system for GPS. It is consistent with the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS).|technology|VERIFIED|NIST|NISTIR 8323|https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8323|https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/wgs_84
